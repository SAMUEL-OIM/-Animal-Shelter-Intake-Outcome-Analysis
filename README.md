# 🐾 Animal Shelter Intake & Outcome Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes animal shelter intake and outcome data to understand patterns in admissions, outcomes, length of stay, and resource utilization.
The analysis is designed to help shelters and community partners **improve placement success, optimize operations, and allocate resources more effectively** using data-driven insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The analysis focuses on answering key operational and strategic questions, including:

* How intake and outcome volumes evolve over time
* What factors influence successful outcomes (live release vs non-live outcomes)
* Which animals experience longer shelter stays or higher risk outcomes
* How intake sources and conditions affect workload and shelter capacity
* Where targeted interventions can improve save rates and efficiency

---

## 📊 Dataset Summary

* **Total Intake Records (Kennels):** 52,343
* **Total Animals:** 50,455
* **Jurisdictions Covered:** 27
* **Average Length of Stay:** 19 days
* **Average Intake Age:** 26 (as recorded in dataset)

---

## ❓ Business Questions & Insights

### 1. How do intake and outcome volumes change over time?

* Intake volume shows clear **seasonal patterns**, peaking between **May and July**.
* Intake is highest mid-week, with **Wednesdays recording the most admissions**.
* Intake declines toward the end of the year (November–February).

**Insight:** Shelters experience predictable seasonal and weekly pressure points.
**Implication:** Staffing, kennel capacity, and medical resources should be scaled during peak periods.

---

### 2. How has the number of pet adoptions changed over time?

* While adoption-specific fields were limited, **live outcomes** were used as a proxy.
* Live outcomes remain consistently higher than non-live outcomes across years.

**Insight:** Adoption and live-release performance is generally stable but strained during high-intake periods.

---

### 3. What is the shelter’s live-release rate?

* **Live Outcomes:** 40,479 (~77%)
* **Non-Live Outcomes:** 11,864 (~23%)

**Insight:** Over three-quarters of animals leave the shelter alive, indicating effective baseline operations with room for improvement.

---

### 4. Which types of pets are adopted most often?

* **Cats and Dogs account for over 80% of total intake and live outcomes.**
* Cats slightly exceed dogs in volume but remain longer in shelters.

**Insight:** High intake does not always translate to fast placement.

---

### 5. Which animals have higher or lower live-release rates?

* Animals admitted in **normal condition** have the highest live-release rates.
* **Stray and wildlife intakes** account for a large share of non-live outcomes.

**Insight:** Intake condition and intake type strongly influence survival outcomes.

---

### 6. Do intake types or conditions lead to different outcomes?

* Normal-condition intakes dominate live outcomes.
* Wildlife and stray animals show higher mortality risk.

**Implication:** Early medical screening and rapid intervention for strays could improve outcomes.

---

### 7. What is the average length of stay?

* **Average Length of Stay:** 19 days
* **Cats** account for the longest cumulative shelter stays.
* Wildlife and livestock stays are comparatively short.

---

### 8. Which animals stay the longest in the shelter?

* Cats remain in shelters the longest.
* Characteristics include high intake volume rather than severe medical issues.

**Insight:** Adoption bottlenecks, not health limitations, drive long stays.

---

### 9. Are there seasonal or day-of-week patterns that affect operations?

* Intake spikes mid-week and during warmer months.
* Mondays consistently record the lowest intake.

**Implication:** Resource allocation should reflect predictable intake cycles.

---

### 10. Which intake sources contribute the largest volumes?

* **Stray intakes** represent the largest intake source.
* Wildlife is the second-largest contributor.

**Insight:** Community outreach and prevention programs should focus on stray populations.

---

### 11. Are there repeat intakes?

* Repeat intake analysis was not conducted due to limited re-entry identifiers.
* This represents an opportunity for improved data tracking.

---

### 12. What actions could improve outcomes?

* Expand spay/neuter and stray prevention programs
* Increase staffing and kennel capacity during peak seasons
* Launch targeted cat adoption campaigns
* Improve intake condition assessment and data completeness

## 📈 Key Findings

* Intake volume is seasonal and predictable
* Normal intake condition strongly correlates with live outcomes
* Cats represent the greatest long-term shelter burden
* Data quality gaps (e.g., unknown sex) limit deeper analysis
